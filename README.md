# AxonOps Installer

This repository contains scripts to install and configure AxonOps, Elasticsearch, and Apache Cassandra.

## Prerequisites

- CentOS/RHEL/RockyLinux 8-9 or compatible
- `dnf` package manager
- Internet connection to download packages or local yum mirrors

##Â Pre-Installed software

- git
- wget
- tar

## Configuration

Before running the installer scripts, configure the environment variables in [./config.env](./config.env).

The AxonOps server requires at least a Elasticsearch server to store configurations and metrics. For clusters
bigger than 6 nodes, it is recommended to store the AxonOps metrics into Cassandra. This can be a single node.
Only the large deployments will require a Cassandra cluster for metrics.

Both are enabled by default on this script. The [./config.env](./config.env) contains the configuration options
to enable or disable them.

## Installation

### Install AxonOps Server and Dashboard

Run the `install_server.sh` script to install and configure AxonOps server, Elasticsearch, and Apache Cassandra:

### Install AxonOps Agent
